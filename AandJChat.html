            <p>AM: We're going to need a rundown of all you know.</p>
            <p>J: The Rift extends across Britain and Ireland specifically. The Rift pulls things from random points in space and time and distributes them elsewhere. Investigation into it by The Briarwood Institute declared that nobody is able to harness or send anything through the Rift, though that might not be entirely true.</p>
            <p>AM: What do you mean by that?</p>
            <p>J: Well, the Rift is getting bigger and more unstable. Presumably because of us and our initial anomaly. Due to the increasing instability, we may be able to harness the Rift just once to stabilise ourselves back into the right flow of events, whilst also stabilising the Rift. After this, we'll be unable to control the Rift in any way ever again.</p>
            <p>AM: And would that close the Rift permanently?</p>
            <p>J: Don't think so. It seems whatever caused the anomaly in the first place left some permanent damage but we can help to heal it, even if just slightly.</p>
            <p>AM: Alright. Do you have plans for how we're to actually do this?</p>
            <p>J: I have The Mechanic sketching up some blueprints right now. Should be done some time soon.</p>
            <p>AM: Thank you, Josiah.</p>

            <p>J: Atticus, do you have the readings I was asking for?</p>
            <p>AI: Yes. Why wouldn't I?</p>
            <p>J: Good question. Anyway, what do the readings say?</p>
            <p>AI: The device is locking onto a possibility outside of our known three.</p>
            <p>J: That makes no sense. If there was another possibility then one of us would have some memory of it. Somebody has had memory of all of the others.</p>
            <p>AI: Yes, well, this is a new science to us all. And this is our one time we can test it - most likely anyway.</p>
            <p>J: I know that. We'll just have to see what happens. How close are we to full solidification?</p>
            <p>AI: The device has estimated several more days potentially.</p>
            <p>J: Alright.</p>

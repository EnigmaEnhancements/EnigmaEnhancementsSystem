            <p>MH: I suppose that explains why the founding keeps changing.</p>
            <p>AM: We're some kind of fluctuation point. We have no real way of telling why but it might explain a lot of the things that have happened to us.</p>
            <p>MH: Jack did tell us he was lying when he said it was his great grandfather, though I suppose he wasn't actually entirely lying, huh? So we have three foundings technically and three founders... all three sort of both real and unreal? Jack, his grandfather and MacGregor?</p>
            <p>AM: The question is which of those was meant to happen? Which is the definite? We just need to find a way of anchoring ourselves and fixing us properly back into history.</p>
            <p>MH: We'll find a way, we always do, right?</p>
            <p>AM: I suppose.</p>
